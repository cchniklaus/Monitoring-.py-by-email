# Monitoring-.py-by-email

Monitoring the Execution of Python Files by email. When the Python file finishes running or encounters an issue during execution, an email will be sent.

To reduce time costs, for Python files that require long execution times, it is necessary to take certain measures to notify the author immediately when the file encounters an error or finishes running. This repository adopts the method of sending emails to achieve such notifications. When the Python file encounters an issue during execution or completes running, the author will receive a corresponding email notification. The repository is set to use a QQ email account as the sender. When using this file, you need to input the sender's email address (a QQ email), the authorization code for the QQ email, and the recipient's email address. 
For example:
Sender's email: 123456789@qq.com
Authorization code: aobnciabvou8ab
Recipient's email: 45678913@qq.com
